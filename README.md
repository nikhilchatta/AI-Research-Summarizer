# 🧠 AI Research Summarizer

**Talk to Research Papers — Don’t Just Read Them**

AI Research Summarizer is a full-stack application that helps you search, summarize, and interact with academic papers from arXiv using large language models. Whether you're a student, researcher, or curious learner, this tool lets you **ask questions directly to papers**, **generate simplified summaries**, and **save key insights for later** — all in one modern interface.

## 🚀 Live Demo (Coming Soon)

> Frontend designs and hosted demo link are under development. Stay tuned for a live experience.

## 📚 Key Features

### 🔍 1. **Search and Summarize**
- Search papers on arXiv by keyword/topic (e.g. "GANs", "Transformers")
- View title, abstract, and author info
- Generate concise GPT summaries using Together AI
- **ELI5 mode**: Ask for summaries explained in simplified, beginner-friendly terms

### 💬 2. **Talk to the Paper**
- Click “Talk to Paper” to embed a paper and make it chatbot-ready
- Ask natural language questions (e.g., "What is the core contribution?")
- Answers are generated using **LangChain + FAISS + GPT**
- Supports **semantic search**, not just keyword matching

### 💾 3. **Save to Library**
- Save favorite papers locally for later reference
- Persistent across sessions (using browser localStorage)
- View your collection anytime from the Library section

### 🗑 4. **Manage Library**
- Delete individual saved papers with one click
- Organize your mini research assistant directly in the browser

## 💡 Why This Project?

Reading academic papers is time-consuming.  
This tool allows you to:
- Scan large volumes of papers quickly
- Understand them at your level (ELI5 summaries)
- Ask questions directly without reading the entire paper
- Build your own searchable knowledge base

## 🧱 Tech Stack Breakdown

### ⚙️ Backend – Flask (Python)
- **Flask API** to serve paper data, summaries, and chatbot answers
- **arXiv API + Web Scraping** for metadata & abstracts
- **LangChain** to manage vector store and prompt pipeline
- **FAISS** to store vector embeddings for retrieval-based Q&A
- **Together AI API (Mixtral model)** for LLM-generated answers & summaries
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for sentence embeddings

### 💻 Frontend – React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **React + TypeScript** SPA
- **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive layout
- LocalStorage for library persistence
- Modular components for Chatbot, PaperList, Library

> ⚠️ **Note**: Full UI polish, responsiveness, and design upgrades are in progress.

## 🧪 How It Works – Under the Hood

1. User searches for papers → app fetches from arXiv
2. GPT summary generated via `/summarize` endpoint
3. Clicking “Talk to Paper” → sends the paper to `/vectorize` and stores it in FAISS
4. Chatbot sends query to `/ask`, which:
   - Searches FAISS for relevant paper chunks
   - Passes context + query to GPT via Together API
   - Returns the generated answer
5. Saved papers go to localStorage and are displayed in “Your Library”

## 🔧 Installation Guide

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Create a `.env` file:

```env
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_ai_key
```

Run the backend:

```bash
python app.py
```
